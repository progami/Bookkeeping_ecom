# Playwright E2E Test Monitoring Report

## Executive Summary
Attempted to run Playwright E2E tests to simulate actual user sessions. The tests revealed a critical issue: Playwright cannot connect to the application properly, resulting in 404 errors for all pages.

## Test Execution Results

### E2E Test Statistics
- **Total E2E tests**: 85
- **Failed**: 84 
- **Passed**: 1 (only basic sync button test)
- **Timeout issues**: Most tests timed out after 30 seconds

### Key Findings

1. **404 Errors on All Routes**
   - Root page (/) returns 404
   - /bookkeeping returns 404
   - /finance returns 404
   - All other routes return 404

2. **Server Configuration Issue**
   - Dev server is running on HTTPS (port 3003)
   - Server logs show successful API calls when accessed directly
   - Playwright config specifies correct baseURL: `https://localhost:3003`
   - But Playwright tests get 404 errors

3. **What's Working**
   - Direct curl requests to https://localhost:3003 work correctly
   - API endpoints respond successfully (200 status codes)
   - Dev server is stable and running without errors
   - Unit tests and business logic tests pass

## Dev Server Monitoring

### Recent Server Activity
```
GET /api/v1/xero/status 200 in 320ms
GET /api/v1/bookkeeping/stats 200 in 23ms
GET /api/v1/bookkeeping/bank-accounts 200 in 25ms
GET /api/v1/bookkeeping/analytics?period=month 200 in 10ms
```

### Server Health
- **Status**: Running ✅
- **Xero Connection**: Active ✅
- **SSL/HTTPS**: Configured correctly ✅
- **API Response Times**: < 500ms ✅

## Issues Identified

### 1. Playwright Cannot Access Application
**Problem**: All Playwright tests fail with 404 errors
**Impact**: Cannot perform automated E2E testing
**Likely Cause**: SSL certificate or routing issue with Playwright

### 2. Test Expectations Don't Match UI
**Problem**: Tests expect elements that don't exist
**Examples**:
- Looking for "Bookkeeping Dashboard" heading
- Expecting buttons with specific names
- Wrong page structure expectations

### 3. No Visual Verification
**Problem**: Cannot take screenshots due to 404 errors
**Impact**: Cannot visually verify UI state

## Recommendations

1. **Fix Playwright Configuration**
   - Check SSL certificate handling
   - Verify webServer configuration in playwright.config.ts
   - Consider using HTTP for testing instead of HTTPS

2. **Update E2E Tests**
   - Map actual UI elements before writing tests
   - Use data-testid attributes for reliable element selection
   - Update test expectations to match current UI

3. **Add Debugging Tools**
   - Enable Playwright trace viewer
   - Add console.log statements in tests
   - Use page.pause() for debugging

4. **Alternative Testing Approach**
   - Use manual testing with monitoring for now
   - Set up proper E2E environment configuration
   - Consider using Cypress or other E2E frameworks

## Conclusion

While the development server is running correctly and APIs are responding well, the Playwright E2E tests cannot connect to the application. This prevents automated user journey testing. The core application functionality appears stable based on API monitoring and unit test results.
