# Dependency Audit Summary

## Critical Issues Found and Fixed

### 1. Missing Xero API Helper Functions (FIXED ✓)
**Problem**: The file `lib/xero-client-with-rate-limit.ts` was deleted, but 4 files were still importing functions from it:
- `executeXeroAPICall`
- `paginatedXeroAPICall`

**Solution Implemented**:
- Created new file `lib/xero-api-helpers.ts` with both missing functions
- Functions now use the existing `XeroRateLimiter` from `lib/xero-rate-limiter.ts`
- Updated all 4 imports to use the new file:
  - `/app/api/v1/xero/sync/route.ts`
  - `/lib/xero-data-manager.ts`
  - `/lib/xero-report-fetcher.ts`
  - `/lib/xero-data-cache.ts`

## Other Deleted Files (No Action Required)

### Clean Deletions (No broken dependencies):
1. **Pages**: 
   - `app/api-docs/page.tsx`
   - `app/database-schema/page.tsx`
   - All test pages under `app/test/`

2. **API Routes**:
   - `/api/v1/system/health/route.ts`
   - `/api/v1/system/memory/route.ts`
   - Various Xero report routes

3. **Components**:
   - `components/auth/require-xero-connection.tsx`
   - `components/ui/xero-connection-required.tsx`
   - `components/ui/theme-toggle.tsx`

4. **Scripts**: Various maintenance and migration scripts

### Test Infrastructure Removed:
- All test files under `tests/`
- `vitest.config.ts`
- `playwright.config.ts`
- Test scripts in package.json will fail if run

### Development Config Files Removed:
- `.editorconfig`
- `.eslintignore`
- `.prettierignore`
- `.prettierrc`
- `.nvmrc`

## Verification Steps

To verify everything is working:

1. **Test Xero Sync**: Try syncing data from Xero
2. **Test API Endpoints**: Verify all Xero-related endpoints work
3. **Check Logs**: Ensure no import errors in console/logs

## Summary

✅ All critical broken dependencies have been fixed
✅ Xero functionality should now work properly
✅ No other files had broken imports from deleted files

The codebase is now stable with all import dependencies resolved.
