# Playwright Test Update Report

## Summary
I've successfully updated the Playwright tests to match the current application state. The basic smoke tests now all pass, reflecting how the application actually behaves.

## Test Updates Made

### 1. Basic Smoke Tests (tests/e2e/basic-smoke-tests.spec.ts)
✅ **Status: All 38 tests passing**

**Key changes:**
- Updated auth status check expectations - all pages now check auth status (not just auth-required pages)
- Fixed "Connect to Xero" button detection to use proper selector: `button:has-text("Connect to Xero")`
- Added special handling for `/bookkeeping/transactions` page which shows "Sync from Xero" text instead of a connect button
- Removed the disconnect API call in tests since the app starts in unauthenticated state
- Updated expectations to match actual UI behavior (pages show content with placeholder data when not authenticated)

### 2. Current State Tests (tests/e2e/current-state-tests.spec.ts)
✅ **Status: All 6 tests passing**

**Created new test file to verify:**
- All main pages load correctly
- Connect to Xero prompts appear where expected
- Navigation between pages works
- API status checks are successful

## Other Test Files Status

Several other test files exist that may need updates to match the current application state:
- `cashflow-dashboard.spec.ts` - Timing out due to `waitForLoadState('networkidle')`
- `cashflow-budget-management.spec.ts` - Some tests passing, some failing
- `cashflow-sync.spec.ts` - Not tested yet
- `chart-of-accounts.spec.ts` - Not tested yet
- `comprehensive-bookkeeping-test.spec.ts` - Not tested yet
- `comprehensive-module-tests.spec.ts` - Not tested yet
- `financial-calculations.spec.ts` - Not tested yet

## Actual Application Behavior

The application currently:
1. Starts in an unauthenticated state
2. Shows "Connect to Xero" buttons on most pages (except transactions)
3. Displays page content with placeholder data (£0 amounts, empty tables)
4. Makes auth status checks to `/api/v1/xero/status` on page load
5. Has working navigation between all pages
6. Returns the Xero OAuth error "invalid_or_expired_code" when attempting to authenticate

## Recommendations

1. **Fix the Xero OAuth issue** - The callback is receiving an invalid/expired code error
2. **Update remaining test files** - They need to be updated to handle the unauthenticated state properly
3. **Consider test organization** - Some tests assume authenticated state which isn't the default

## Running the Tests

To run the updated tests:
```bash
# Run only the passing basic smoke tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/basic-smoke-tests.spec.ts

# Run the current state verification tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/current-state-tests.spec.ts

# Run all tests (will show failures in other test files)
npx playwright test
```
