# Performance Optimizations Summary

## Issue
Navigation from the main finance page to sub-modules (bookkeeping, cashflow, analytics) was taking a long time even locally.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **No Caching**: API calls were making fresh requests to the database/Xero every time
2. **Heavy Initial Data Loads**: Multiple parallel API calls on page load without optimization
3. **Cashflow Forecast Performance**: 
   - Making individual database writes for each forecast day (90+ writes)
   - No caching of expensive calculations
   - Xero API calls without rate limiting optimization
4. **No Prefetching**: Sub-module data wasn't being prefetched when users hover over navigation links
5. **Heavy Chart Libraries**: Recharts components were being loaded synchronously

## Optimizations Implemented

### 1. API Response Caching
- Added cache headers to all API routes with appropriate TTLs:
  - Balance Sheet & P&L: 5 minutes cache
  - VAT Liability: 10 minutes cache
  - Analytics data: 10 minutes cache
  - Bank accounts: 3 minutes cache
  - Stats: 1 minute cache

### 2. Cashflow Engine Optimization
- Implemented Redis caching for forecast results (5-minute TTL)
- Changed from individual DB writes to batch transactions
- Added cache check before expensive calculations

### 3. Client-Side Optimizations
- Added performance monitoring utilities
- Implemented prefetch on hover for sub-module navigation
- Added cache headers to fetch requests

### 4. Lazy Loading
- Implemented dynamic imports for Recharts components
- Charts now load asynchronously, reducing initial bundle size

### 5. Next.js Configuration
- Enabled SWC minification
- Added global cache headers for API routes
- Configured compression and optimization flags

### 6. Performance Utilities Added
- `measurePageLoad()`: Tracks page load metrics using Navigation Timing API
- `prefetchSubModuleData()`: Prefetches API data when hovering over navigation
- `RequestQueue`: Prevents concurrent API calls and implements client-side caching

## Results Expected

1. **Faster Navigation**: Sub-modules should load 50-70% faster due to cached data
2. **Reduced Server Load**: Caching reduces database queries and Xero API calls
3. **Better UX**: Prefetching on hover makes navigation feel instant
4. **Lower Memory Usage**: Lazy loading charts reduces initial JavaScript bundle

## Monitoring

To monitor improvements, check the browser console for performance logs:
```
[Performance] Bookkeeping Dashboard Metrics: {
  totalLoadTime: "XXXms",
  domContentLoaded: "XXXms",
  timeToFirstByte: "XXXms",
  domInteractive: "XXXms"
}
```

## Future Optimizations

1. Implement service worker for offline support
2. Add IndexedDB for longer-term client storage
3. Use React Query or SWR for better data fetching
4. Implement virtual scrolling for large data tables
5. Add progressive enhancement for slow connections
