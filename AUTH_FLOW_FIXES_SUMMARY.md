# Auth Flow Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Finance Page Auth Callback Handling
**File**: `/app/finance/page.tsx`
- Fixed async/await syntax error in useEffect
- Added proper OAuth callback handling with `checkAuthStatus()` call
- Ensures UI updates after successful connection

### 2. Cookie Management in Disconnect
**File**: `/app/api/v1/xero/disconnect/route.ts`
- Fixed cookie deletion to properly clear tokens
- Added multiple deletion methods to ensure cookie is removed
- Prevents empty cookie issue that was causing stale auth state

### 3. AuthContext State Updates
**File**: `/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`
- Added immediate state update in `disconnectFromXero()`
- Added logging for debugging state changes
- Removed redundant auth status check that was overriding local state

### 4. UI State Management
**File**: `/app/finance/page.tsx`
- Removed duplicate `xeroStatus` state variable
- Fixed loading logic to prevent showing empty state when connected
- Added proper dependency arrays to useEffect hooks

## Connect/Disconnect Workflow

The workflow now works as follows:

1. **Disconnected State**:
   - Finance page shows "Welcome to Your Financial Hub" empty state
   - "Connect to Xero" button is visible
   - No financial data is displayed

2. **Connect Flow**:
   - Click "Connect to Xero" → Redirects to `/api/v1/xero/auth`
   - Redirects to Xero login page
   - After successful auth, redirects back to `/finance?connected=true`
   - Finance page detects callback, shows success toast, and updates UI
   - Financial data is fetched and displayed

3. **Connected State**:
   - Finance page shows financial dashboard with metrics
   - Organization name is displayed in header
   - "Disconnect" button is visible
   - Financial modules are accessible

4. **Disconnect Flow**:
   - Click "Disconnect" → Shows confirmation dialog
   - On confirm, calls `/api/v1/xero/disconnect`
   - Cookie is properly deleted
   - AuthContext immediately updates to show disconnected state
   - UI immediately updates to show empty state without page reload

## Key Improvements

1. **Immediate UI Updates**: Both connect and disconnect now update the UI immediately without requiring page refresh
2. **Proper Cookie Management**: Cookies are properly deleted on disconnect
3. **State Synchronization**: AuthContext state properly syncs with actual auth status
4. **Error Handling**: Better error messages and handling throughout the flow

## Testing

The auth flow has been tested with automated Playwright tests confirming:
- Disconnect properly clears auth state
- Connect redirects to Xero login
- UI updates correctly based on auth state
- Navigation between pages maintains correct auth state

## Next Steps

If issues persist:
1. Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
2. Verify cookies are being set/cleared in browser DevTools
3. Check network tab for API response status codes
4. Ensure no browser extensions are interfering with cookies
