# Backend Production Readiness Audit - TODO

## üìä Current Production Readiness Score: 5/10 (Downgraded by Tester)

### üß™ TESTER AUDIT SUMMARY (2025-06-16)
**Tested by**: 30-year experienced QA specialist
**Overall Status**: CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND - Application not production ready

#### Major Issues Identified:
1. **Authentication Broken** - Session management fails after API calls
2. **Data Not Loading** - Despite successful Xero connection, no data appears
3. **API Authorization Failing** - 401 errors on authenticated requests
4. **No User Feedback** - Errors occur silently without notifications
5. **State Inconsistency** - UI shows different auth states in different components

## ‚ùå INCOMPLETE

### üö® CRITICAL (P0) - Security & Data Integrity
*Must fix before production deployment*

- [ ] **Input Validation & Sanitization**
  - [ ] Add Zod validation schemas for all API routes
  - [ ] Implement request body validation middleware
  - [ ] Add SQL injection prevention for dynamic queries
  - [ ] Sanitize user inputs before database operations

- [ ] **Session Validation**
  - [ ] Implement proper session validation
  - [ ] Secure all admin endpoints
  - [ ] **[TESTER IDENTIFIED] Fix session persistence after API calls** - Session is lost after sync operation
  - [ ] **[TESTER IDENTIFIED] Implement proper session refresh mechanism** - Auth state not maintained properly

- [ ] **Monitor Memory Usage**
  - [ ] Monitor memory usage patterns

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY (P1) - Performance & Reliability
*Fix within first week of production*

- [ ] **Implement Caching Strategy**
  - [ ] Re-enable Redis with proper configuration
  - [ ] Add cache invalidation logic
  - [ ] Cache frequently accessed data (GL accounts, tax rates)
  - [ ] Implement cache warming strategy

- [ ] **API Performance Optimization**
  - [ ] Fix N+1 queries in bank transactions
  - [ ] Add pagination to all list endpoints
  - [ ] Implement query result batching
  - [ ] Add database query optimization

- [ ] **Single Data Fetch Strategy**
  - [ ] **Implement One-Time API Call Pattern**
    - All Xero API data should be fetched ONCE per session/refresh
    - No repeated calls to same endpoints during session
    - Data refresh ONLY on:
      - Manual refresh button click
      - New sign-in/authentication
      - Scheduled background sync
  
  - [ ] **Fix Multiple API Call Issues**
    - Current: P&L, Balance Sheet, VAT, Account balances fetched repeatedly
    - Solution: Fetch all data once on app load/refresh
    - Store in session-scoped cache (memory/Redis)
    - Affected endpoints:
      - `/api/v1/xero/reports/profit-loss-live`
      - `/api/v1/xero/reports/balance-sheet-live`
      - `/api/v1/xero/accounts`
      - `/api/v1/xero/reports/vat-liability-live`
      - `/api/v1/xero/accounts-with-balances`

  - [ ] **Create Unified Data Store**
    - Session-based cache for all Xero data
    - Pattern: Fetch once ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Serve from cache
    - Cache key: `xero:${tenantId}:${dataType}`
    - TTL: Session duration or manual refresh
    - Clear only on explicit refresh/re-auth

  - [ ] **Global Refresh Mechanism**
    - Single refresh endpoint: `/api/v1/xero/refresh-all`
    - Fetches all data in parallel (respecting rate limits)
    - Updates all caches atomically
    - Returns refresh timestamp
    - Prevents concurrent refresh requests

- [ ] **Error Handling Standardization**
  - [ ] Create standardized error response format
  - [ ] Implement global error handler
  - [ ] Add error classification (user vs system)
  - [ ] Remove sensitive info from error messages

- [ ] **Rate Limiting Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to all endpoints
  - [ ] Implement per-user rate limits
  - [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting
  - [ ] Create rate limit headers

### ‚ö° MEDIUM PRIORITY (P2) - Scalability & Monitoring

  - [ ] Create alerting rules

- [ ] **API Improvements**
  - [ ] Add OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
  - [ ] Implement API versioning strategy

### Bookkeeping Module Fixes (2025-06-16)
- [x] **Sync Button Returns 404**
  - Problem: `/api/v1/xero/sync` endpoint was not registered
  - Solution: Fixed route registration and added proper body validation

- [x] **Sync Operation Fails After First Transaction**
  - Problem: Variable name conflict between `tx` (Prisma transaction) and `tx` (Xero transaction)
  - Solution: Renamed Xero transaction variable to `xeroTx` to avoid conflict
  - Result: Sync now completes successfully with all data imported

- [x] **User Feedback on Sync Operations** (Partially)
  - Fixed: Added loading toast notification during sync
  - Fixed: Added success toast with record count after sync
  - Fixed: Added error toast notifications for failures

- [x] **Hardcoded Currency Rates**
  - Location: `/app/api/v1/bookkeeping/cash-balance/route.ts`
  - Old Rates: USD: 0.79, EUR: 0.86, PKR: 0.0028, SEK: 0.074
  - Solution Implemented:
    - Created CurrencyRate model in database
    - Implemented CurrencyService with caching
    - Added fallback rates for reliability
    - Integrated currency sync into Xero sync process
    - Future-ready for Xe.com API integration

- [x] **Brittle Report Parsing**
  - Location: `/app/api/v1/bookkeeping/financial-summary/route.ts`
  - Issue: Hardcoded string matching for 'Total Bank', 'Total Assets', etc.
  - Risk: Will break when Xero changes report format
  - Solution Implemented:
    - Created XeroReportParser class with configuration-driven parsing
    - Flexible search terms for each field type
    - Fallback values for missing data
    - Support for different report structures
    - Easy to update configuration without code changes
