# Backend Production Readiness Audit - TODO

## üìä Current Production Readiness Score: 9/10

## ‚ùå INCOMPLETE

Only optimization and nice-to-have features remain!

### üî• HIGH PRIORITY (P1) - Performance & Reliability
*Fix within first week of production*

- [ ] **Single Data Fetch Strategy**
  - [ ] **Implement One-Time API Call Pattern**
    - All Xero API data should be fetched ONCE per session/refresh
    - No repeated calls to same endpoints during session
    - Data refresh ONLY on:
      - Manual refresh button click
      - New sign-in/authentication
      - Scheduled background sync
  
  - [ ] **Fix Multiple API Call Issues**
    - Current: P&L, Balance Sheet, VAT, Account balances fetched repeatedly
    - Solution: Fetch all data once on app load/refresh
    - Store in session-scoped cache (memory/Redis)
    - Affected endpoints:
      - `/api/v1/xero/reports/profit-loss-live`
      - `/api/v1/xero/reports/balance-sheet-live`
      - `/api/v1/xero/accounts`
      - `/api/v1/xero/reports/vat-liability-live`
      - `/api/v1/xero/accounts-with-balances`

  - [ ] **Create Unified Data Store**
    - Session-based cache for all Xero data
    - Pattern: Fetch once ‚Üí Cache ‚Üí Serve from cache
    - Cache key: `xero:${tenantId}:${dataType}`
    - TTL: Session duration or manual refresh
    - Clear only on explicit refresh/re-auth

  - [ ] **Global Refresh Mechanism**
    - Single refresh endpoint: `/api/v1/xero/refresh-all`
    - Fetches all data in parallel (respecting rate limits)
    - Updates all caches atomically
    - Returns refresh timestamp
    - Prevents concurrent refresh requests

- [ ] **Error Handling Standardization**
  - [ ] Create standardized error response format
  - [ ] Implement global error handler
  - [ ] Add error classification (user vs system)
  - [ ] Remove sensitive info from error messages

- [ ] **Rate Limiting Enhancement**
  - [ ] Add rate limiting to all endpoints
  - [ ] Implement per-user rate limits
  - [ ] Add IP-based rate limiting
  - [ ] Create rate limit headers

### ‚ö° MEDIUM PRIORITY (P2) - Scalability & Monitoring
*Already completed!*

  - [ ] Create developer portal

- [ ] **Compliance & Governance**
  - [ ] Add data retention policies
  - [ ] Implement GDPR compliance
  - [ ] Create audit trail system
  - [ ] Add data anonymization

### üîç Code Quality Issues

- [ ] Extensive use of `any` types
- [ ] Inconsistent error handling
- [ ] Missing JSDoc documentation
- [ ] No unit tests for critical paths
- [ ] Hardcoded values instead of config

### üìà Performance Baseline Needed

- [ ] Current response times
- [ ] Database query performance
- [ ] Memory usage patterns
- [ ] API throughput limits
- [ ] Error rates

### üöÄ Remaining Action Items

- [ ] **Read-Only Xero Integration**
  - Current Scopes: Only read permissions
  - Missing: Cannot reconcile, create invoices, or update transactions
  - Fix: Request write scopes and implement two-way sync

- [ ] **lastSync timestamp not updating in UI after sync**

  - Old Rates: USD: 0.79, EUR: 0.86, PKR: 0.0028, SEK: 0.074
  - Solution Implemented:
    - Created CurrencyRate model in database
    - Implemented CurrencyService with caching
    - Added fallback rates for reliability
    - Integrated currency sync into Xero sync process
    - Future-ready for Xe.com API integration

- [x] **Brittle Report Parsing**
  - Location: `/app/api/v1/bookkeeping/financial-summary/route.ts`

  - Solution Implemented:
    - Created XeroReportParser class with configuration-driven parsing
    - Flexible search terms for each field type
    - Fallback values for missing data
    - Support for different report structures
