   - Security considerations

## Development Guidelines

### TypeScript

- Use strict mode
- Define interfaces for all data structures
- Avoid `any` type - use `unknown` if needed
- Use enums for constants

### React Components

- Use functional components with hooks
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop typing
- Implement error boundaries where appropriate

### API Development

- Follow RESTful conventions
- Validate all inputs with Zod schemas
- Return consistent error responses
- Document all endpoints

### Testing

- Write unit tests for utilities and helpers
- Write integration tests for API endpoints
- Write E2E tests for critical user flows
- Aim for >80% code coverage
