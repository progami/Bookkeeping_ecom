# Sync Performance Fixes Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Transaction Sync N+1 Query Problem (FIXED)
**Problem**: The transaction sync was making individual database queries for each bank account, causing 41-second delays per account even with 0 transactions.

**Solution**: 
- Replaced the loop that made individual `prisma.bankAccount.findUnique()` calls with a single batch query using `prisma.bankAccount.findMany()` with an `in` clause
- This reduces N database queries to just 1 query, significantly improving performance

**Code Changes**:
```typescript
// Before (N+1 queries):
for (const account of bankAccounts) {
  const bankAccountRecord = await prisma.bankAccount.findUnique({
    where: { xeroAccountId: account.accountID! }
  });
}

// After (1 query):
const xeroAccountIds = bankAccounts.map(account => account.accountID!).filter(Boolean);
const bankAccountRecords = await prisma.bankAccount.findMany({
  where: {
    xeroAccountId: {
      in: xeroAccountIds
    }
  }
});
```

### 2. Persistent UI State for Sync Tracking (FIXED)
**Problem**: When users navigated away from the sync page, they lost the syncId and couldn't track progress.

**Solution**:
- Enhanced `GlobalSyncMonitor` to verify sync status on mount
- Added proper localStorage persistence and validation
- When the component mounts, it checks if the stored sync is still active via API
- Only shows the sync UI if the sync is actually still in progress

**Code Changes**:
- Updated `GlobalSyncMonitor` to fetch sync status from API on mount
- Added proper cleanup when sync completes or fails
- Ensures sync state persists across page navigation

## Performance Improvements

1. **Database Query Optimization**: Reduced transaction sync bank account lookups from N queries to 1 query
2. **Added Performance Logging**: Added timing metrics to track sync performance
3. **Maintained Existing Optimizations**: The transaction sync already uses a single paginated API call to fetch all transactions (not per account)

## Testing Recommendations

1. Start a historical sync and verify:
   - Transaction sync completes much faster (should be seconds, not 41 seconds per account)
   - Navigate away from the sync page and return - sync progress should persist
   - Sync UI blocks navigation appropriately
   - Performance logs show improved transaction sync times

2. Check the logs for:
   - `[Historical Sync Worker] Completed all transactions sync` - should show improved duration
   - No more N+1 query warnings
   - Proper checkpoint saves

## Next Steps

1. Monitor the sync performance in production
2. Consider adding similar batch query optimizations to other entities if needed
3. Add metrics/monitoring for sync performance tracking
